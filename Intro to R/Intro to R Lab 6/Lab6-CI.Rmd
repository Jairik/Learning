# Introduction

Our goal in statistics in general is to estimate the value of an unknown population parameters, such as a population mean (like average income) or a proportion from a binomial population (proportion of unemployed people). The unknown population parameter (e.g. mean or proportion) that we are interested in estimating is called the **target parameter**.

A single number calculated from the sample that estimates a target population parameter is called a **point estimator**. For example, we can use sample mean $\overline{X}$ to estimate population mean $\mu$. Being a single number point estimator is easy to compute. On the other hand, since sample is random, point estimator is random as well. Hence, we do not know how well the point estimator estimated the true value of target parameter.

An **interval estimator** (or **confidence interval**) is a formula that tells us how to use the sample data to calculate an interval that estimates the target parameter. While it is definitely more complex than finding point estimator, the biggest advantage of interval estimators is that they come with **measure of reliability**.

The procedure for constructing confidence intervals relies on the Central Limit Theorem. According to the Central Limit Theorem, the sampling distribution is approximately normal if one of the following is true:

-   either sample is large enough, i.e. at least 30 observations, and the sample is selected from **any** population with a finite mean and a finite standard deviation.
-   or sample is selected from a population, which itself is approximately normally distributed

In this lab assignment students will use a Shiny App to generate random samples from various distributions and construct confidence intervals. Depending on distribution of "parent" population and sample size, confidence level (the most common confidence levels are 90%, 95%, and 99%) will be achieved and may be lower than expected.

Recall the formula of the confidence interval of mean (when the assumptions of central limit theorem are satisfied).

-   When the population standard deviation $\sigma$ is known, the $(1-\alpha)*100$ % confidence interval is given by

    $$
    \overline{X}\pm z_{\alpha/2}\frac{\sigma}{\sqrt{n}}
    $$

-   When the population standard deviation $\sigma$ is unknown, but the sample standard deviation $s$ is known, then the $(1-\alpha)*100$ % confidence interval is given by

    $$
    \overline{X}\pm t_{n-1,\alpha/2}\frac{s}{\sqrt{n}}
    $$

From the above formula, you can see the center of ONE confidence interval is determined by the sample mean $\overline{X}$, and the width of THAT confidence interval is determined by sample size $n$, standard deviation $\sigma$ or $s$, and the confidence coefficient $(1-\alpha)$ .

The confidence interval computed from a random sample using the above formula provides the range that we can be $(1-\alpha)*100$ % confident that the population mean will lie within this range. We will explore the meaning of such statement in today's lab.

But before that, let's first learn how to create a table (more specifically, a data frame) that contains the data we want to type in, and present it in R Markdown report.

# Part 0: Create a Data.Frame with type-in Data and Present It As a Table

Suppose that we want to create a table with three column. The first column has name "Sample Size", with values: 10, 40, 90; the second column has name "Num of CIs Covering True Mean", with values 89, 91, 93; the third column has name "Ave Width of CIs", with values 1.042, 0.522, 0.348. Finally, add a title to this table as "90% CI stats based on 100 random samples from a normal population". How to do that?

First, create three objects corresponding to the three column.

We can use the syntax

object \<- c(xx,xx,xx,...,xx)

Here object can be replace by the simplified name of the column (if you have space, use "\_" instead), and "xx" are the values in that column.

```{r}
Sample_Size <- c(10,40,90)
Num_Cover <- c(89,91,93)
CI_width <- c(1.042, 0.522, 0.348)
```

Next, we create the data frame object that combine the three columns. The syntax is:

df \<- data.frame(first_column, second_column, ..., last_column)

Again, you can replace "df" by the name you prefer about this table. And the "first_column", etc. should be the column objects you defined previously.

```{r}
CI_table_90_normal <- data.frame(Sample_Size, Num_Cover, CI_width)
CI_table_90_normal
```

Now, change the column names

```{r}
colnames(CI_table_90_normal)<-c("Sample Size", "Num of CIs Covering True Mean", "Ave Width of CIs")
CI_table_90_normal
```

Finally, present the data frame in a nicer table.

```{r}
library(knitr)
kable(CI_table_90_normal,padding=6,align="ccc",caption="90% CI stats based on 100 random samples from a normal population")


```

Up to this point, we have learned how to create a data frame with type-in data, and present it in R Markdown. We will use this technique in the assignments later.

Now, back to our confidence intervals. We will use the Shiny app "CIapp.R"

Recall Lab 5. Similarly, double click the file "CIapp.R", open it with RStudio, click the "Run App" button on the right-top corner of the editor, and **TYPE YOUR NAME AND DATE IN THE TEXTBOX ON THE LEFT-BOTTOM CORNER**.

You can see the detailed information on the tab "Sample Details".

# Part I: Effects of Standard Deviation Used, Confidence Coefficient, and Sample Size.

In this part, we start with the normal distribution. We will explore how do the standard deviation used, confidence coefficient, and sample size effect the width of the confidence interval (and thus the reliability of the estimation).

First, about the **standard deviation known or not**. Recall that if the population variance (standard deviation) is unknown, then we will use the sample variance (standard deviation) and t distribution to compute the confidence interval.

## Assignment 1

1.  Set the Population Distribution as "Normal", The Population Variance Known is "Yes", the Confidence Coefficient is "0.95", the Sample Size is "30", and the Number of Samples is "100".

2.  Go to tab "Confidence Interval - Sample Mean". Save the plot to the same folder of this R Markdown file (name it as "assignment1_2.png"), and insert that plot below.

![CI .95 - Normal Distribution n = 30](assignment1_2.png)

3.  Based on the above results, what is the proportion of confidence intervals covering the true population mean? What is the average width of these confidence intervals? Do the widths of these confidence intervals equal to each other?

    ```         
    The proportion of intervals covering the true population mean is .95, with the average width of intervals being .716. These widths are not equal.
    ```

4.  Now keep all the other input the same, change the Population Variance Known to "No". Save the plot to the same folder of this R Markdown file (name it as "assignment1_4.png"), and insert that plot below.

![CI .95 - Normal Distribution n = 30 PopVar = Not Known](assignment1_4.png)

5.  What is the proportion of confidence intervals covering the true population mean? What is the average width of these confidence intervals? Do the widths of these confidence intervals equal to each other? Explain why if there is a difference between 2 and 3.

    ```         
    The proportion of intervals covering the true population mean is .93, with the average width of intervals being .75592. Similarly to last time, these widths are not equal. When the population variance is unknown, the proportion of intervals covering the true population mean decreased and the widths of the intervals increased. This likely occurs because the graph must take the uncertainty of the population into account.
    ```

**End of Assignment 1**

Next, about the **Confidence Coefficient**

## Assignment 2

1.  Set the Population Distribution as "Normal", Pop Variance Known as "No", Confidence Coefficient as "0.80", Sample Size as "40", Number of Samples as "100".

2.  Go to "Confidence Interval - Sample Mean", download the figure and post it below.

![Confidence Interval Normal CC = .8 n = 40](CI_Sample_Mean_Normal_.8_40.png)

3.  Based on the result, what is the proportion of CIs that cover the true mean? What is the average width of CIs?

    ```         
    The proportion of CIs that cover the true mean is .81, while the average width of confidence interals is .41202.
    ```

4.  Repeat question 2,3, but for different confidence coefficients "0.85", "0.90", "0.95", "0.99", respectively.

![Confidence Interval Normal CC = .85 n = 40](CI_Sample_Mean_Normal_.85_40.png)

```         
The proportion of CIs that cover the true mean is .84, while the average width of confidence interals is .46686.
```

![Confidence Interval Normal CC = .90 n = 40](CI_Sample_Mean_Normal_.90_40.png)

```         
The proportion of CIs that cover the true mean is .90, while the average width of confidence interals is .53558.
```

![Confidence Interval Normal CC = .95 n = 40](CI_Sample_Mean_Normal_.95_40.png)

```         
The proportion of CIs that cover the true mean is .94, while the average width of confidence interals is .643.
```

![Confidence Interval Normal CC = .99 n = 40](CI_Sample_Mean_Normal_.99_40.png)

```         
The proportion of CIs that cover the true mean is .98, while the average width of confidence interals is .86094.
```

5.  Now, based on the above results, use the technique in Part 0, create a table that contains three columns: "Coefficient Coefficient" with values 0.80, 0.85, 0.90, 0.95, 0.99; "Prop of CIs cover True Mean" with values you observed in the previous steps; "Ave Width of CIs" with values you observed in the previous steps. Then add a title "CIs from Normal Pop - Different Confidence Coefficients - Sample Size 40". Present the R codes and the table below:

    ```{r}
    library(knitr)

    ##Creating Three Columns
    Coefficient <- c(.80, .85, .90, .95, .99)
    Prop_of_CIs_Cover_True_Mean <- c(.81, .84, .9, .94, .98)
    Width_of_CIs <- c(.41202, .46686, .53558, .643, .86094)

    ##Creating dataFrame
    CIs_From_Normal_Pop <- data.frame(Coefficient, Prop_of_CIs_Cover_True_Mean, Width_of_CIs)

    ##Changing Column Names and formatting into nice table
    colnames(CIs_From_Normal_Pop) <- c("Coefficient", "Prop of CIs cover True Mean", "Ave Width of CIs") 
    kable(CIs_From_Normal_Pop, padding=6,align="ccc",caption = "CIs from Normal Pop - Different Confidence Coefficients - Sample Size 40")

    ```

6.  Based on the results on 5, describe how does the proportion of CIs that cover true means, and the average width of CIs changes when confidence coefficient increases? Explain your observations.

    ```         
    As the confidence coefficient increases, the proportion of CIs that cover true means increase at around the same rate. Throughout the samples, they are consistently within one of the confidence coefficient, almost exactly mirroring. The average width of CIs also increases with the confidence coefficient, increasing seemingly exponentially. Additionally, the average widths seem to be approaching 1.
    ```

**End of Assignment 2**

The next factor we are interested in is the **sample size**.

## Assignment 3

1.  Set the Population Distribution as "Normal", Pop Variance Known as "No", Confidence Coefficient as "0.95", Sample Size as "10", Number of Samples as "100".

2.  Go to "Confidence Interval - Sample Mean", download the figure and post it below.

![95% Coefficient Samples Size =10](CI_Sample_Mean_Normal_.95_SS10_s100.png)

3.  Based on the result, what is the proportion of CIs that cover the true mean? What is the average width of CIs?

    ```         
    The proportion of CIs that cover the true mean are .92, while the average width of CIs are 1.41598.
    ```

4.  Repeat question 2,3, but for different sample sizes "40", "90", "160", "250", respectively.

![95% Coefficient Samples Size =40](CI_Sample_Mean_Normal_.95_SS40_s100.png)

```         
The proportion of CIs that cover the true mean are .97, while the average width of CIs are .64094.
```

![95% Coefficient Samples Size =90](CI_Sample_Mean_Normal_.95_SS90_s100.png)

```         
The proportion of CIs that cover the true mean are .95, while the average width of CIs are .42214.
```

![95% Coefficient Samples Size =160](CI_Sample_Mean_Normal_.95_SS160_s100.png)

```         
The proportion of CIs that cover the true mean are .96, while the average width of CIs are .31252.
```

![95% Coefficient Samples Size =250](CI_Sample_Mean_Normal_.95_SS250_s100.png)

```         
The proportion of CIs that cover the true mean are .94, while the average width of CIs are .24958.
```

5.  Now, based on the above results, use the technique in Part 0, create a table that contains three columns: "Sample Size" with values 10, 40, 90, 160, 250;"Prop of CIs cover True Mean" with values you observed in the previous steps; "Ave Width of CIs" with values you observed in the previous steps. Then add a title "95% CIs from Normal Pop - Different Sample Sizes". Present the R codes and the table below:

    ```{r}
    library(knitr)

    ##Creating Three Columns
    Sample_Size <- c(10, 40, 90, 160, 250)
    Prop_of_CIs_Cover_True_Mean <- c(.92, .97, .95, .96, .94)
    Width_of_CIs <- c(1.14598, .64094, .42214, .31252, .24958)

    ##Creating dataFrame
    CIs_From_Normal_Pop <- data.frame(Sample_Size, Prop_of_CIs_Cover_True_Mean, Width_of_CIs)

    ##Changing Column Names and formatting into nice table
    colnames(CIs_From_Normal_Pop) <- c("Sample Size", "Prop of CIs cover True Mean", "Ave Width of CIs")
    kable(CIs_From_Normal_Pop, padding=6,align="ccc",caption = "CIs from Normal Pop - Different Sample Sizes")
    ```

6.  Based on the results on 5, describe how does the proportion of CIs that cover true means, and the average width of CIs changes when sample size increases? Explain your observations.

    ```         
    The proportion of CIs that cover the true increases with sample size until it peaks at a sample size of 40, then it slowly roughly decreases. As the sample size increases, the average width of CIs decreases at a decreasing exponential rate, slowing down as the sample size gets larger. It appears to be approaching 0 as the sample size increases.
    ```

7.  Now, summarize the observations in assignment 2 and 3. When the coefficient coefficient increase, how does the proportion of CIs cover true means and the average width of CIs changes? How about the effect when the sample size increase? Do you prefer settings that has a higher proportion of CIs that cover the true mean? Do you prefer settings that has a small average CI width? Based on the answers of the above questions, what should you do if you want to maintain a high proportion and a small average CI width at the same time?

    ```         
    When the coefficient changes, then the proportion of CIs covering true means and the average width of CIs both increase, with the proportion to true means nearly mirroring the coefficient and the average width seemingly approaching one. When the sample size increases, the proportion of CIs covering true means stays around the same, peaking around a sample size of 40. The area widths of CIs, however, decreases as the sample size increases. 
    It may be more desirable to have a higher proportion of CIs that cover the true mean whenever more precision is required, however this may come at the cost of having larger ranges. Conversely, it may be more desirable to have smaller CI width when a smaller range is desired and when precision is less crucial. If you want to maintain a high proportion and small width, it may be most beneficial to choose a large sample size (small proportion trade-off with dramatically smaller average widths) and a coefficient around .90-.95 (The average widths exponentially increase as coefficient gets larger, so a coefficient around the middle gets the best of both worlds).
    ```

**End of Assignment 3**

# Part II: Effect of Population Distribution

In part I, we have studied the effects of standard deviation used, confidence coefficient, and sample size for **Normal Population Distribution**. As we discussed in the introduction, the theoretic foundation of confidence interval for mean is the **Central Limit Theorem (CLT)**. Recall the assumptions needed for CLT:

1.  The "parent" population has a finite mean $\mu$

2.  The "parent" population has a finite standard deviation $\sigma$

3.  a\. The "parent" population follows a normal distribution (then sample size $n$ doesn't matter), OR

    b\. The "parent" population can be **ANY** distribution, as long as assumptions 1 and 2 are satisfied, and the sample size $n$ is sufficiently large ($n\geq 30$ for most of the cases).

In this part, let's explore the effect of different "parent" distribution to CIs.

We start with small sample size (n=5). Since we are discussing different distribution, we will NOT compare the width of confidence intervals between different distribution. However, we do prefer the widths of CIs remain close to each other within the same distribution (especially when we don't know the population standard deviation and using the sample standard deviation, which is the most common case in practice). In addition, we want to check whether the CIs not covering true mean is balance (i.e., whether there are more not-covering-true-mean CIs lie on the left-hand side (or right-hand side) of the true mean)

## Assignment 4

1.  Set the Population Distribution as "Normal", Pop Variance Known as "No", Confidence Coefficient as "0.80", Sample Size as "5", Number of Samples as "100".

2.  Go to "Confidence Interval - Sample Mean", download the figure and post it below.

![](assingment4_2.png)

3.  Based on the result, what is the proportion of CIs that cover the true mean? How many CIs not cover true mean on the left? On the right? Are the difference between left and right greater than 5? Are the widths of CIs relatively close to each other?

    ```         
    The proportion of CIs that cover the true mean is .77, with the CIs not covering the true mean to the left being 11 and the CIs not covering the right being 12. This difference is not greater than 5, and the width of the CIs are not very close to each other, with fairly large variances throughout the widths.
    ```

4.  Repeat question 2,3, but for different population distributions "Uniform", "Right Stewed", "Left Stewed", "Bimodal", and "Cauchy", respectively.

![Uniform n=30](CI_Uniform_n30.png) `The proportion of CIs that cover the true mean is .78, with the CIs not covering the true mean to the left being 12 and the CIs not covering the right being 10 (which does not have a difference greater than 5). The width of the CIs look very roughly close to each other, although there are some outliers.` ![Right Skewed n=30](CI_Right_Skewed_n30.png) `The proportion of CIs that cover the true mean is .71, with the CIs not covering the true mean to the left being 23 and the CIs not covering the right being 6. This does have a difference greater than 5, with significantly more CIs not being covered on the left side. The width of the CIs may be close to each other, although the widths do have large variance.`

![Left Skewed n=30](CI_Left_Skewed_n30.png) ``` The proportion of CIs that cover the true mean is .75, with the CIs not covering the true mean to the left being 5 and the CIs not covering the right being 20. This does have a difference greater than 5, with significantly more CIs not covering the right. Similarly to right-skewed,``the width of the CIs may be close to each other, although the widths do have large variance.``. ```

![Bimodal n=30](CI_Bimodal_n30.png) `The proportion of CIs that cover the true mean is .86, with the CIs not covering the true mean to the left being 10 and the CIs not covering the right being 4. This does have a difference greater than 5, with more CIs not covering the left. The width of the CIs are fairly close to each other.`

![Cauchy n=30](CI_Cauchy_n30.png) `The proportion of CIs that cover the true mean is .60, with the CIs not covering the true mean to the left being 0 and the CIs not covering the right being 40. This difference is obviously greater than 5, with all CIs not covering the mean being on the right. Although it is hard to tell if the widths are close, I would argue that they are not close.`

5.  Now, based on the above results, use the technique in Part 0, create a table that contains three columns: "Parent Distribution" with values c("Normal", "Uniform", "Right Stewed", "Left Stewed", "Bimodal", "Cauchy"); "Prop of CIs cover True Mean" with values you observed in the previous steps; "Num of left CI not cover true mean" with values you observed in the previous steps; "Num of right CI not cover true mean" with values you observed in the previous steps.. Then add a title "80% CIs from Different Pop - Sample Size 5". Present the R codes and the table below:

    ```{r}
    library(knitr) #Ensuring that the library is installed

    #Creating the three columns
    Parent_Distribution <- c("Normal", "Uniform", "Right Skewed", "Left Skewed", "Bimodal", "Cauchy")
    Prop_of_CIs_Cover_True_Mean2 <- c(.77, .78, .71, .75, .86, .60)
    Num_Of_Left_CI_Not_Cover_True_Mean <- c(11, 12, 23, 5, 10, 0)
    Num_Of_Right_CI_Not_Cover_True_Mean <- c(12, 10, 6, 20, 4, 40)

    #Creating the dataFrame
    CIs_From_Different_Pop <- data.frame(Parent_Distribution, Prop_of_CIs_Cover_True_Mean2, Num_Of_Left_CI_Not_Cover_True_Mean, Num_Of_Right_CI_Not_Cover_True_Mean)

    #Changing column names & formatting
    colnames(CIs_From_Different_Pop) <- c("Parent Distribution", "Prop of CIs Cover True Mean", "Num of Left CI Not Cover True Mean", "Num of Right CI Not Cover True Mean")
    kable(CIs_From_Different_Pop, padding=6, align="ccc",caption="80% CIs from Different Pop - Sample Size 5")
    ```

6.  Based on the results on 5, describe your observations. When the sample size is small, will you trust the results of confidence interval when the you believe the sample data is not from a normal distributed population? Why or why not? (You may want to discussed the different distributions separately)

    (remember you can check the normality using QQ-plot, more details will be discussed in Lab 7)

    ```         
    When the sample size is small, the only distribution that I would trust is Uniform distribution. It had a relatively high proportion of CIs covering the true mean, and a fairly equal number of CIs not covering the mean on both the left and right (12 and 10) (this makes sense considering the distribution, I would assume that these would be equal, on average). As for right skewed and left skewed, I would not trust these distribution, as they had a completely disproportionate amount of CIs not covering the mean on the right and left side, respectively. For Bimodal, I would also not completely trust this distribution, as there were noteably more CIs not covering the true mean on the left side than the right side. However, the proportion of CIs covering the true mean is the highest out of all distributions, so it is more trust than left and right skewed. Cauchy, on the other hand, cannot be trusted at all. This distribution had the lowest proportion of CIs covering the mean, had extremely large widths, and had an extreme difference of CIs on the left and right side (0 vs 40).
    ```

**End of Assignment 4**

What if the sample size is large enough?

## Assignment 5

Repeat and answer all questions in steps 1-5 in Assignment 4, but change the sample size to 500.

![Normal n=500](CI_Normal_n500.png) `The proportion of CIs that cover the true mean is .85, with the CIs not covering the true mean to the left being 8 and the CIs not covering the right being 7 (which does not have a difference greater than 5). The width of the CIs look very close to each other.`

![Uniform n=500](CI_Uniform_n500.png) `The proportion of CIs that cover the true mean is .73, with the CIs not covering the true mean to the left being 10 and the CIs not covering the right being 17. This does have a difference more than 5, with 7 more CIs not covering the right than the left. The width of the CIs look very close to each other.`

![Right Skewed n=500](CI_Right_Skewed_n500.png) `The proportion of CIs that cover the true mean is .76, with the CIs not covering the true mean to the left being 14 and the CIs not covering the right being 10. This does have a difference greater than 5, with more CIs not being covered on the right side. The width of the CIs look very close to each other.`

![Left Skewed n=500](CI_Left_Skewed_n500.png) `The proportion of CIs that cover the true mean is .71, with the CIs not covering the true mean to the left being 13 and the CIs not covering the right being 16. This does not have a difference greater than 5. The widths of the CIs look very close to each other.`

![Bimodal n=500](CI_Bimodal_n500.png) `The proportion of CIs that cover the true mean is .81, with the CIs not covering the true mean to the left being 8 and the CIs not covering the right being 11. This does not have a difference greater than 5. The width of the CIs seem to be very close to each other.`

![Cauchy n=500](CI_Cauchy_n500.png) `The proportion of CIs that cover the true mean is .56, with the CIs not covering the true mean to the left being 0 and the CIs not covering the right being 44. This difference is obviously greater than 5, with all CIs not covering the mean being on the right. The widths do not seem to appear very close.`

```{r}
library(knitr) 

#Creating the three columns
Parent_Distribution <- c("Normal", "Uniform", "Right Skewed", "Left Skewed", "Bimodal", "Cauchy")
Prop_of_CIs_Cover_True_Mean3 <- c(.85, .73, .76, .71, .81, .56)
Num_Of_Left_CI_Not_Cover_True_Mean1 <- c(8, 10, 14, 13, 8, 0)
Num_Of_Right_CI_Not_Cover_True_Mean1 <- c(7, 17, 10, 16, 11, 44)

#Creating the dataFrame
CIs_From_Different_Pop <- data.frame(Parent_Distribution, Prop_of_CIs_Cover_True_Mean3, Num_Of_Left_CI_Not_Cover_True_Mean1, Num_Of_Right_CI_Not_Cover_True_Mean1)

#Changing column names & formatting
colnames(CIs_From_Different_Pop) <- c("Parent Distribution", "Prop of CIs Cover True Mean", "Num of Left CI Not Cover True Mean", "Num of Right CI Not Cover True Mean")
kable(CIs_From_Different_Pop, padding=6, align="ccc",caption="80% CIs from Different Pop - Sample Size 500")
```

Then answer the question. When the sample size is large, will you trust results of confidence interval when the you believe the sample data is not from a normal distributed population? Why or why not? (You may want to discussed the different distributions separately)

```         
When the sample size is large, I will only trust the results of the confidence interval for Normally and Bimodally distributed data. Both of these distributions had a large proportion of CIs covering the true mean (.85 and .81, respectively) and had a close amount of CIs not covering the true mean on the left and the right. As for the others, however, I would not trust the results of the other distributions. To my surprise, when increasing the sample size of the Uniform distribution, the difference between the number of CI not covering the mean from the left and right increased dramatically. Additionally, it had a low proportion of CIs covering the true mean of .73. The left and right distribution only had a few differences (3 and 4, respectively), however they had a low proportion of CIs covering the true mean. Lastly, as with the last case, the Cauchy distribtion had a very low proportion of .56 and an even larger difference between the right and left, now having a difference of 44.

# Appendix: Define a R Function to Compute CI

Just for your knowledge, not part of this lab. We can define the following R function to compute CI for a given data set or given sample statistics.

```{r}

CI_data <- function(data, PopSDknown, PopSDvalue, ConfCoef, digit ){
  
  # data should be a column of numeric data
  # PopSDknown should be "Yes" or "No", whether the Population standard deviation is known or not.
  # PopSDvalue should be the value of the pop sd value. If pop sd is NOT known, just input 0.
  # ConfCoef is the confidence coefficient, should be a real number between 0 and 1.
  # digit is the number of digits you want to present in the CI
  
  x_bar <- mean(data)
  n <- length(data)
  
  confLv <- ConfCoef*100
  
  if (PopSDknown == "Yes"){
        crval <- qnorm((1+ConfCoef)/2)
        SD <- PopSDvalue
        output1 <- paste("The population standard deviation is", bquote(.(PopSDvalue)))
        
  }
  else if (PopSDknown == "No"){
        crval = qt((1+ConfCoef)/2,n-1)
        SD <- sd(data)
        output1 <- paste("The population standard deviation is unknown.")
  }
  
  ci_ub <- round(x_bar + crval*SD/sqrt(n),digit)
  ci_lb <- round(x_bar - crval*SD/sqrt(n),digit)
  

  
  
  cat(output1,"\nThe sample size is", bquote(.(n)), ". The sample mean is", bquote(.(x_bar)), ". The sample standard deviation is", bquote(.(sd(data))),"\nThe", bquote(.(confLv)), "% Confidence Interval for the population mean is (", bquote(.(ci_lb)), bquote(.(ci_ub)), ").\n" )
  
}


```

Let's try it.

```{r}
x <- rnorm(100,5,3)
CI_data(x,"No",0,0.95,4)


```

```{r}

CI_data(x,"Yes",3,0.95,4)
```

The next one is finding the CI with sample stat given (not the raw data).

```{r}
CI_stat <- function(x_bar,n, PopSDknown, SD, ConfCoef, digit ){
  
  # x_bar is the sample mean
  # n is the sample size
  # PopSDknown should be "Yes" or "No", whether the Population standard deviation is known or not
  # SD is the pop sd or sample sd, depends on the input of PopSDknown
  # ConfCoef is the confidence coefficient, should be a real number between 0 and 1.
  # digit is the number of digits you want to present in the CI
  

  confLv <- ConfCoef*100
  
  if (PopSDknown == "Yes"){
        crval <- qnorm((1+ConfCoef)/2)
        output1 <- paste("The population standard deviation is", bquote(.(SD)))
        
  }
  else if (PopSDknown == "No"){
        crval = qt((1+ConfCoef)/2,n-1)
        output1 <- paste("The population standard deviation is unknown.")
  }
  
  ci_ub <- round(x_bar + crval*SD/sqrt(n),digit)
  ci_lb <- round(x_bar - crval*SD/sqrt(n),digit)

  
  cat(output1,"\nThe sample size is", bquote(.(n)), ". The sample mean is", bquote(.(x_bar)), ". The sample standard deviation is", bquote(.(SD)),"\nThe", bquote(.(confLv)), "% Confidence Interval for the population mean is (", bquote(.(ci_lb)), bquote(.(ci_ub)), ").\n" )
  
}
```

```{r}
CI_stat(4.711773,100,"Yes",3,0.95,4)
```
