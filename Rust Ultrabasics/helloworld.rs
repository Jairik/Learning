/* This blazingly-fast Rust program utilizes the blazingly-fast fn main() function and the blazingly-fast println! 
macro to output  "Hello, World!" to the console, leveraging Rust's blazingly-fast sophisticated memory management 
and type inference systems to ensure efficient execution. Through its meticulous and blazingly-fast handling of 
system-level operations, the program exemplifies Rust's ability to manage ownership and memory 
safety while delivering a blazingly-fast simple string output.
